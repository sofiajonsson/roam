# Welcome to Roam!
Created by: Mera Stackhouse and Sofia Jonsson
## What is Roam?
Roam was created to be a travel focused social media site. Users can signup/login and browse posts. They are able to browse other users and follow and unfollow them. They will have a personalized feed, accessed through the navigation bar, based on who they follow and their posts.

## Configuration
- Clone the repository to your computer
- Navigate to the parent folder, `roam`
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `rails s` in your server to start your local server
- Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser
- Also available on: https://roam-travel-app.herokuapp.com/

## Project Requirements
Build a Rails app that:

1. Has at least five models. Of these, there must be at least one relationship between your models.

2. Has some methods in your models. These are to be used to better extract data from your tables.

3. Doesn't use JavaScript. JavaScript will be used in the next Module.

4. Accesses a Sqlite3 database using ActiveRecord.

5. Allows the user to perform CRUD operations using forms in the browser. Not all of your models must use all 4 crud operations, but you must have given the user the ability to use each of the 4 of them at some place in your app.

6. Uses MVC. Your work should be split up appropriately in the models, views, and controllers that you write.
